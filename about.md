Welcome
=======

I'm a builder and operator exploring startups, strategy, and how to create meaningful impact.

**Currently:** Co-Founder at Stealth (Nov 2025 - Present)

**Recently:** Founded Littlewise, an EdTech venture (Jul - Oct 2025)

**Before that:** Led PnL at MyMuse India as Head of Business, where I scaled revenue 2x and reduced costs 2x. Learned deeply about consumer businesses and category creation.

I'm passionate about building, learning through doing, and sharing what I've learned along the way. My journey has taken me from banking to startups to social impact—each experience shaped how I think about building and leading today.

Career Journey
==============

**Littlewise** (Founder, Jul - Oct 2025)  
Short but intense journey building an EdTech product.

**MyMuse India** (Head of Business, Apr 2024 - Jul 2025)  
Led the company PnL, increased revenue 2x and reduced costs 2x. Learned a lot about consumer businesses and category creation.

**Chief of Staff → Founders Office Finance** (Sep 2023 - Aug 2023)  
As the #2 business hire, I did a bit of everything—from investor relations to logistics. No work was beneath me. This is where I learned the startup mindset: the mix between logic and optimism, and how to reframe challenges as opportunities.

**R.E.A.L. - Racial Equality for Arbitration Lawyers** (Director, May 2020 - Jun 2023)  
Worked on racial equity in the legal profession.

**Goldman Sachs** (Investment Banking Analyst, Apr 2021 - Jun 2022)  
A role I worked incredibly hard to get—only to realize core finance wasn't for me. But I found great mentors and learned that life is too short to do something you're not having an absolute blast doing.

**180 Degrees Consulting DRC** (Founder, Jul 2019 - Jul 2021)  
Founded an all-women social sector consulting branch on campus to give students hands-on project experience.

**Harvard University** (Nov 2020 - Apr 2021)  
Researched effects of COVID on marginalized communities. Conducted interviews with people in low-income groups—a deeply educational experience that taught me the value of listening and getting work done.

**Early Internships** (2017 - 2020)  
Niti Aayog, NSE, BDO, Axis Capital, EY—explored economics, accounting, finance, and consulting before finding my path.

What I've Learned
=================

I've changed careers more times than I can count. Each pivot taught me something new. The common thread: I'm most energized when building something, learning something, or solving a real problem. I've learned to trust that impulse.
