I am a builder and operator exploring startups, strategy, and meaningful impact. I currently work as the Co Founder of a Stealth venture where I am building from first principles and working through the early stages of product and team formation.

Before this I founded Littlewise, an EdTech venture I built from Jul to Oct 2025. It was a short but intense experience that sharpened my thinking around user needs, rapid experimentation, and early stage product direction.

Earlier I led the business at MyMuse India as Head of Business from Apr 2024 to Jul 2025. I ran the full PnL, scaled revenue two times, reduced costs two times, and learned deeply about consumer brands and category creation. It taught me how momentum is built inside a company and how to run lean without losing ambition.

Before MyMuse I worked in the Founders Office and in Chief of Staff roles where I supported investor relations, finance, and operations. No work was beneath me and this was where I learned the real startup mindset which is a balance of logic, optimism, and fast action.

Earlier experiences in banking and social impact shaped the way I work today. I spent time at Goldman Sachs, learning discipline and pace, and worked at R E A L on racial equity in the legal profession. I also founded the DRC branch of 180 Degrees Consulting and carried out research at Harvard University on the effects of COVID on marginalised communities.

Through all these roles I have learned that I am most energised when I am building, learning through doing, and solving real problems. Every pivot clarified this and I now trust that instinct to guide me forward.
