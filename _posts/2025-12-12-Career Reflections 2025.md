This one an update to a friend who I haven't talked to this year.

Hi,

2025 was wild. I hated it and I loved it. After many years it made me feel alive.

***Where was I at the start of the year?***

I was working at MyMuse as Head of Business. The company was doing great, I was doing great. I was also very part time working on my startup Littlewise. I had planned to apply to bschool since 2021 and had taken a lot of decisions in life to get there. Start of the year was also the time where I was conflicted if I should apply this year or not.

***What objectively changed?***

Oh so much. so so much. 

I had given myself a deadline to quit my job by June- the month I would have completed 3 years with the organisation. I quit my job in June. Reason: I wasn't learning anymore, I wasn't failing enough, and I have some foolishness in me to take wild risks right now so why not? I don't believe in taking life too seriously, atleast for now. 

Lets go through the next 6 months in detail: 
June, July: It was night and day to work on something over weekends and full time. I needed full time. I started working on Littlewise (Development toys brand for kids) full time and very soon realised that we had no product MOAT. Before realising this I had ordered inventory, built website, started marketing. 

August: Started thinking to do things in parallel to Littlewise. I thought that trying out multiple things at once will open up probability for one of them to work. Started working on a Meal Tracking App as a growth co founder. Did all sorts of hacky stuff :p got some views and users but none of it matters if you don't have strong conviction in what you're building. Conviction is somehow related to gut feeling as well. You can lack it in greatest of ideas. I was also trying out ideas with another friend in parallel and did some idea evaluations and small pilots. The most difficult thing about August wasn't to stop working on ideas but to stop working with the co founders as both of them were great but our startup vision didn't align.

September, October: Things started breaking here. I spent 15 days researching on a new idea which I realised wouldn't work. I was in 4th month of having no job now and I had no co founder and no idea. To be entirely honest, I never regretted trying things out. I owed it to myself to give myself a fair chance. I thought I was ready to start working again and can always think of ideas and find co founder while working somewhere. I started looking for jobs. I hadn't applied to jobs in a very long time and was well aware of the gruesome job market. I still had high expectations. The job should be at a high growth company, which has smart people working there, would be great if it were remote, and pays me well. It's very difficult to not let imposted syndrome kick in while in this cycle- what if I was overvalued in my last role? What if I am not that capable? Although, I kept on reminding myself- what if I were? This was a terrible experience overall. Random ghostings from HR's and not hearing back from places you were excited about can take a toll. Things started picking up in 5th week of applying where I started getting offers. They didn't tick all my expectations but were more than halfway there (and paid well so ok i guess). This is when I met Sparsh on Y Combinator co founder matching. We had a strong value and vision alignment. Finding a great co founder who also wanted to work on same ideas and had same goals was the most difficult thing in this process. I am a hopeful person so all I could think of was - what if this works out? It'll make up for a great team. 

November, December: 6th month of unemployment started. I took a decision to let of the job offers and give entrepreneurship 3 more months. Sparsh and I started exploring and working on ideas together. We worked on an idea for 45 days only for both of us to realise it won't work. Mid December- we took a new approach. We'll do sprints and look for focused results instead of going into the macro view of things. No idea works fully. We just had to find something we both think would work. We started working on a work management platform that lies at the intersection of organisational context ( it takes into account the people aspect and live view of what's up in your org) and project management. We are 6 days into it and we think it's a super cool space. We are both very excited but I guess 2026 will tell what's in the cards.

*What am I proud of?*
Working on your startup is the best feeling ever but it also feels like you're getting kicked everyday. There is a new failure every day. Sometimes internal sometimes external. It can range from co founder issues, idea issues, to market issues, talent issues. There is just so much that can go wrong. I am proud that I am able to think more about everything that can go right and have remained positive through this entire process. If anything I think this has brought me closer to myself and have made be a better person.

*Where did I struggle or stall?*
I would say discipline. I've had cycles of sleeping at 4pm and waking up at 11pm on some days. It's wild. I need to work more on being disciplined. 

*What did this year teach me about myself?*

- I am stronger than I thought I was and I am capable of much more than I thought I was
- I suck at multi tasking. If I am into working- I lose focus of everything else. There are days of not stepping out of my room. Big nails small nails I don't realise. I become extremely one dimensional and lose focus of anything else in life.
- Money is great. It matters. But it isn't the most important thing for me. I would want comfortable lifestyle but I can be happy without a luxurious one. 
- Creating impact, moving fast, working on challenging problems is super exciting currently. However, I crave success the most. 
- I am happier with non linear trajectory and I regret missed chances more than missed opportunities.
- Career is a part of life for me. The end goal is to do something that makes me happy.
